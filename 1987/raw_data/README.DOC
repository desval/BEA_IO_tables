Description of data

      This diskette contains data from the 1987 benchmark input-output
      (I-O) accounts as published in "Input-Output Accounts of the U.S.
      Economy, 1987," SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS 74  (April 1994).
      Reprints of the article are available from the above address at a
      cost of $25.

      Methodology, coverage of data, and data definitions are noted in
      the SURVEY article describing the benchmark I-O.

      Data files containing the tables are fixed format ASCII files
      consisting of a row I-O code, a column I-O code, the table
      reference number, and the cell value(s).  Values represent
      millions of dollars in producers' prices.  All values are right
      justified with decimals shown explicitly.  All cells in the
      tables are included.  No copyrighted data are found in these
      files.

      Table 2.--The Use of Commodities by Industries, includes the data
      found in SURVEY tables 2.1 and 2.2, and transportation costs and
      margins for each transaction.

      Tables 1, 2, and 3 have been compressed.  Approximate disk space
      required for the tables:

            Table 1     --  6.5 megabytes
            Table 2     -- 25.8 megabytes
            Table 3     --  6.5 megabytes

Procedure for using disk

      Copy all diskette files to a directory on your hard disk.  At the
      DOS prompt, type TBLX-87, where X is table number 1, 2, or 3, to 
      uncompress the data files.

      A program has been included to extract data from tables 1, 2, or 
      3;  see IOXTRACT.DOC.
