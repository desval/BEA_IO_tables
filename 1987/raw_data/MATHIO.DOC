     Mathematical Derivation of the Total Requirements Tables
                   for the Input-Output Study 1/


The following are definitions:

     q    is a column vector in which each entry shows the total
          amount of the output of each commodity.

     U    is a commodity-by-industry matrix in which the column
          shows for a given industry the amount of each commodity it
          uses, including Noncomparable imports (I-0 80) and Scrap,
          used and secondhand goods (I-0 81).  I-0 81 is designated 
          below as scrap. 

     ^    is a symbol that, when placed over a vector, indicates a
          square matrix in which the elements of the vector appear
          on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
                                                            ^
     i    is a unit (summation) vector containing only l's; i is the
          identity matrix (I).


     e    is a column vector in which each entry shows the total
          final demand purchases for each commodity from the use
          table (table 2).

     g    is a column sector in which each entry shows the total
          amount of each industry's output, including its production
          of scrap.

     V    is an industry-by-commodity matrix in which the column
          shows for a given commodity the amount produced in each
          industry. V has columns showing only zero entries for
          noncomparable imports and for scrap. The estimate of V is
          contained in columns 1 - 79 of the make table (table 1)
          plus columns of zeros for columns 80 and 81.

     h    is a column vector in which each entry shows the total
          amount of each industry's production of scrap.  The
          estimate of h is contained in column 81 of the make table.
          Scrap is separated to prevent its use as an input from
          generating output in the industries in which it
          originates.

     B    is a commodity-by-industry matrix in which entries in each
          column show the amount of a commodity used by an industry
          per dollar of output of that industry.  Matrix B is derived
          from matrix U.
                                                                 2

     D    is an industry-by-commodity matrix in which entries in
          each column show, for a given commodity (excluding scrap),
          the proportion of the total output of that commodity
          produced in each industry. D is referred to as the market
          share matrix.

     p    is a column vector in which each entry shows the ratio of
          the value of scrap produced in each industry to the
          industry's total output.

     W    is an industry-by-commodity matrix in which the entries in
          each column show, for a given commodity, the proportion of
          the total output of that commodity produced in each
          industry adjusted for scrap produced by the industry.
          This matrix is the transformation matrix.

The following are identities:

                         (1) q = Ui + e

                         (2) g = Vi + h


The following are assumptions:

     Inputs are required in proportion to output and the
     proportions are the same for an industry's primary and
     secondary products (the industry technology assumption); then:

                                     ^
                            (3) U = Bg

     Each commodity (other than scrap) is produced by the various
     industries in fixed proportions (the market shares
     assumption); then:
                                     ^
                            (4) V = Dq
     Scrap output in each industry is proportional to total output
     of the industry; then:
                                    ^
                            (5) h = pg








                                                                 3

The model expressed in equations (1) through (5) thus involves three
constants (B, D, p) and six variables (U, V, h, e, q, g). The model
solution is derived as follows:

     Substituting (3) into (1) gives:

                         (6) q = Bg + e

     Substituting (4) into (2) gives:

                         (7) g - h = Dq

     Substituting (5) into (7) and solving for g:
                                 ^
                             g - pg = Dq
                                  ^
                             (I - p)g = Dq

                                       ^ -1
                          (8) g = (I - p)  Dq

                                   ^ -1
                          Let (I - p)   D = W, then

                          (9) g = Wq

     Substituting (9) into (6) and solving for q:

                              q = BWq + e

                              (I - BW)q = e

                                           -1
                          (10) q = (I - BW)  e

     Substituting (10) into (9) gives:
                                           -1
                         (11) g = W(I - BW)  e
        -1
(I - BW)   is the commodity-by-commodity total requirements matrix,
giving commodity output required per dollar of each commodity
delivered to final users./2
         -1
W(I - BW)   is the industry-by-commodity total requirements matrix,
giving the industry output required per dollar of each commodity
delivered to final users./2

      National Accounts recommended by the United Nations.  See: A System of 
      National Accounts Studies in Methods, Series F No. 2 Rev. 3, United
      Nations, New York, 1968; also, Stone, R., Bacharach, M. & Bates, J.,

2.    Tables are prepared at the detailed and summary levels of aggregation. 
      For the summary tables, the adjustments for secondary production were
      made at the detailed level, then aggregated before calculation of the
      total requirements tables.
